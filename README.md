Media entity provides a 'base' entity for a media element. This is a very basic
entity which can reference to all kinds of media-objects (local files, YouTube
videos, tweets, CDN-files, ...). This entity only provides a relation between
Drupal (because it is an entity) and the resource. You can reference to this
entity within any other Drupal entity.

This module further provides some example Form Display widgets and Display
widgets to use this entity from the referencing entity. This module also aims
to make the creations of new widgets as easy as possible.

This module attempts to provide the base module for the D8 media ecosystem. It
aims to combine the best of D7 solutions such as:

- Media/File entity
- Scald
- Mediabox
- Asset

This project/initiative was started at DrupalCon Prague. See groups.drupal.org/node/327768
